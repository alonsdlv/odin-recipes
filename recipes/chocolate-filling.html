    <p><strong>Bittersweet Dark Chocolate Ganache Filling for Macarons</strong></p>
    <p>Our Dark Chocolate Ganache is an emulsion of dark and milk chocolates, heavy cream, honey, and butter. These ingredients are carefully combined at the proper temperature, which results in a smooth and robustly flavoured macaron filling</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>100 pieces Macaron shells chocolate</li>
        <li>250 g Dark chocolate couverture 58% or similar high quality dark chocolate</li>
        <li>50 g Milk chocolate couverture 38% or similar high quality milk chocolate </li>
        <li>250 g Heavy cream, 35% fat</li>
        <li>20 g Honey</li>
        <li>45 g Unsalted European-style butter, 82% fat, room temperature</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Arrange the macaron shells one row facing up and the next row facing down on a baking tray lined with parchment paper and set aside.</li>
        <li>Combine the heavy cream and honey in a saucepan. Bring to a simmer. Pour it over the chocolate and gently stir.</li>
        <li>Starting with a small rotating circle in the center of the bowl, whisk to blend and homogenize the mixture.</li>
        <li>As more of the mixture comes together into a smoother and slightly thicker consistency, extend the whisk outward into a bigger circle, but still whisking from the center of the bowl. The mixture will incorporate more of the liquids from the sides of the bowl throughout the homogenization process.</li>
        <li>Add the soft butter and blend for about 5 sec using an immersion blender until the mixture is smooth and glossy</li>
        <li>Cover the bowl and allow the ganache to cool for 20-30 min at room temperature. Then refrigerate. Transfer the ganache to a pastry bag and bring to room temperature before piping it onto the macaron shells.</li>
        <li>Assemble macarons</li>
    </ol>
